# ComicBooksDataModel
This .NET class library describes the data model for a Comic Book catalogue. The catalogue's database is currently being created in SQL Server Management Studio. A web based interface will also be added to the project in the near future.

The progress and planned updates for this project can be tracked [here](https://trello.com/b/bOZxylr6) on Trello.
