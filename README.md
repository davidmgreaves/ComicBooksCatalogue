# ComicBooksDataModel
This .NET class library currently describes the preliminary data model for a Comic Book catalogue. The model's current state is reflected in a corresponding database in SQL Server Management Studio. A web based interface will also be added to the project in the near future.

The progress and planned updates for this project can be tracked [here](https://trello.com/b/bOZxylr6) on Trello.
